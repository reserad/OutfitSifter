# OutfitSifter
An app to organize and recommed your closet.

An Android app that allows the user to create a virtual closet by taking pictures of their clothing items. These items can then be paired together and made into an outfit which is stored in the closet. At any given day, the user can
simply specify what they are wearing from the closet and the clothing combo will be saved into a calendar. If the user doesn't feel like wearing a generic outfit that they pre-made, there's also a randomize clothing button on the home page. The outfit 
generated will attempt to avoid monochromatic outfits. Weather is also a key factor. If rain is in the forecast, OutfitSifter will alert you. As you might expect, the randomized outfits can also be saved into your closet. Under random outfit, if you 
specify within the settings when you work, those days will recommend only work attire. Finally, there can be multiple profiles per device. You can specify gender and based off of gender, you will have different camera features. For example, for female you have the ability to create one-piece outfits.

4. This screen shows up when you choose not to take pictures when the “make outfit” button is pressed on the home screen. Swiping left and right, you can change what shirts, pants, or shoes etc appear on this screen. When you got everything aligned how you want, go ahead and click the “save outfit” button.

5. Inside the closet, you now see that you have 1 outfit showing. You can then tell the app you've decided to wear that specific app and it makes a note that you wore that outfit that specific day. From now on, whenever you scroll to the outfit you just wore, it will alert you the last time you wore it.
